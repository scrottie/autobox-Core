1.21  Mon Sep 26 16:15:19 PDT 2011
    New Features
    - $string->reverse will now always reverse the string regardless of context.
      (Technically an incompatible change, but the list behavior of $string->reverse
      was clearly useless).

    Distribution Changes
    - fix MANIFEST (thanks Steffen Müller).
    - move POD History section into standard Changes file (chocolateboy).
    - look, a change log!

    Misc
    - removed unnecessary prototypes on methods (schwern)
    - updated dependency on autobox


1.2 Fri Mar 19 12:11:00 2010
    - fixes version 1.1 losing the MANIFEST and being essentially
      a null upload. Bah!
    - merges in brunov's flip, center, last_index, slice,
      range, documentation, and various bug fixes.

1.1 Thu Mar 18 13:33:00 2010
    - actually adds the tests to the MANIFEST so they get bundled.
    - Thanks to http://github.com/daxim daxim/Lars DIECKOW for clearing
      out the RT queue (which I didn't know existed), merging in the fixes and
      features that still applied, which were several.

1.0 Sun Mar  7 22:35:00 2010
    - is identical to 0.9. PAUSE tells me 0.9 already exists so
      bumping the number. *^%$!

0.10 Mon Jan 25 17:18:00 2010
    - no change recorded.

0.9 Mon Jan 25 17:07:00 2010
    - is identical to 0.8. PAUSE tells me 0.8 already exists so bumping the number.

0.8 Mon Jan 25 14:28:00 2010
    - fixes unshift and pop to again return the value removed
      (oops, thanks brunov) and adds many, many more tests (wow, thanks brunov!).

0.7 Thu Mar  4 23:07:00 2010
    - uses autobox itself so you don't have to, as requested, and
      ... oh hell. I started editing this to fix Schwern's reported v-string
      warning, but I'm not seeing it.
    - Use ~~ on @array->grep if we're using 5.10 or newer.
    - Add an explicit LICENSE section per request.
    - Took many tests and utility functions from perl5i.
    - Pays attention to wantarray and returns a list or the reference, as dictated by context.
    - flatten should rarely if ever be needed any more.

0.6 Mon May 26 05:19:00 2008
    - propogates arguments to autobox and doesn't require you to use
      autobox. I still can't test it and am applying patches blindly. Maybe I'll
      drop the Hash::Util dep in the next version since it and Scalar::Util are
      constantly wedging on my system.
      The documentation needs to be updated and mention of Perl6::Contexts mostly removed.
    - JJ contributed a strip method for scalars - thanks JJ!

0.5 Tue May 13 23:59:00 2008
    - has an $arrayref->unshift bug fix and and a new flatten method for hashes.
    - this version is untested because my Hash::Util stopped working, dammit.

0.4 Sat Jan  5 17:00:00 2008
    - got numeric operations.

0.3 Wed Jan  5 21:12:00 2005
    - fixes a problem where unpack wasn't sure it had enough arguments
      according to a test introduced in Perl 5.8.6 or perhaps 5.8.5.
      This problem was reported by Ron Reidy - thanks Ron!
    - added the references to Perl 6 Now and the excerpt.

0.2 Sat May 29 21:42:00 2004
    - rounded out the API and introduced the beginnings of functional-ish methods.

0.1 Tue Mar 30 09:51:00 2004
    - woefully incomplete initial version.
